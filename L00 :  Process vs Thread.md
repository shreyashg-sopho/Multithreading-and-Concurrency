# Difference Between Process and Thread

## Process

A **process** is an independent program in execution, which has its own memory space, system resources, and execution context. Processes are the fundamental unit of resource allocation in a computer system.

### Characteristics of a Process:
- **Independent Execution**: Each process runs independently, and processes do not share memory space by default.
- **Memory Allocation**: Processes have their own separate memory space, including the program code, data, and other resources.
- **Resource Intensive**: Processes require significant resources and system overhead due to the need for separate memory and CPU scheduling.
- **Inter-process Communication (IPC)**: Since processes are independent, they need mechanisms like pipes, sockets, shared memory, or message passing for communication.
- **Context Switching Overhead**: Switching between processes (context switching) is more resource-intensive because it involves saving and loading the process’s memory, registers, and other execution information.

### Example:
Running two instances of an application (e.g., two instances of a web browser) results in two separate processes, each having its own memory and resources.

## Thread

A **thread** is a smaller, lightweight unit of execution within a process. Multiple threads in a single process share the same memory space and system resources, making them more efficient for performing concurrent tasks.

### Characteristics of a Thread:
- **Shared Memory**: Threads within the same process share the same memory space, including variables and program state.
- **Lightweight**: Threads are more lightweight compared to processes because they use the same resources, avoiding the overhead of creating separate memory spaces.
- **Faster Context Switching**: Switching between threads is faster because they share the same memory and resources.
- **Concurrency**: Threads can be used to perform tasks concurrently within a single process, making better use of CPU resources.
- **Communication**: Threads within the same process can communicate directly by accessing shared memory, but this can lead to **race conditions** if not synchronized properly.

### Example:
In a web server process, multiple threads might handle incoming requests concurrently. All threads share the server's memory, making the system more efficient.

## Key Differences Between Process and Thread:

| Feature               | Process                                             | Thread                                                |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**         | A process is a program in execution.                | A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. |
| **Memory**             | Each process has its own memory space.              | Threads within the same process share memory.          |
| **Resource Allocation**| Heavy resource allocation, each process requires its own memory and resources. | Lightweight, threads share resources and memory.       |
| **Communication**      | Processes communicate through Inter-process Communication (IPC) mechanisms. | Threads communicate by accessing shared memory.        |
| **Creation Overhead**  | High overhead due to separate memory allocation and management. | Lower overhead, as threads share the same memory space.|
| **Context Switching**  | Slower, requires saving/restoring memory and registers. | Faster, only thread registers need to be saved/restored. |
| **Crash Behavior**     | If one process crashes, it doesn’t affect other processes. | If one thread crashes, it may affect the whole process. |
| **Concurrency**        | Processes run in isolation, suitable for parallelism. | Threads allow efficient concurrency within a single process. |

## Summary:
- **Processes** are heavier, isolated units of execution with their own memory and system resources. Communication between processes is more complex and resource-intensive.
- **Threads** are lightweight and share memory within the same process. They are more efficient for tasks that can run concurrently but require careful management of shared resources to avoid synchronization issues.
